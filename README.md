# Day Planner

This is a <strong>day planner</strong> that helps you organize your tasks for a working day. It is a simple calendar app that you can use to schedule your activities. It has time boxes set for standard work hours <strong>(9AM - 5PM)</strong> and users can add notes and reminders for tasks they need to do throughout the day.

# Layout


The webpage has a layout that has two main sections: A <strong>jumbotron</strong> and the <strong>calendar</strong> itself. The date for the day is displayed on the jumbotron and the calendar is a table that has 9 rows for 9 hours.

# Working

Users can edit the text boxes to add tasks for different times of the day. Once the desired input is typed in, users have to press save to commit their text input to <strong>local storage</strong>. This ensures that the tasks will still be there to see when the page is reloaded.

The time boxes are <strong>color-coded</strong> to represent the time in the past, present and future. Users can easily understand what task was set to be done at what time of the day.

As you can see, all tasks that have been saved will be accessible whenever the user visits the website. If a task needs to be changed, it can be easily edited and saved using the corresponding <strong>save button</strong>.
